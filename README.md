# Simple Quiz App

A simple and fast-paced quiz application built with React. Test your knowledge under pressure!

## Features

- **Engaging Questions:** A set of multiple-choice questions to challenge your knowledge.

- **10-Second Timer:** Each question has a strict 10-second timer. You must answer before the time runs out!

- **Automatic Submission:** If the timer expires on any question, the quiz automatically ends.

- **Instant Scorecard:** Once the quiz ends (either by completing all questions or by running out of time), your final score is displayed immediately.

- **Clean UI:** A minimalist and user-friendly interface.

## How It Works

1. Start the quiz.

2. For each question, a 10-second countdown begins.

3. Select an answer before the timer hits zero.

4. If you fail to answer within the time limit, the quiz will end, and your score will be shown.

5. If you answer all questions, your final score will be calculated and displayed.
